# Logistic-Regression-for-IoT-Intrusion-Detection-using-RT-IoT2022-Dataset
This project explores the application of **logistic regression models** for **binary classification** (normal vs. attack traffic) using the **RT-IoT2022 dataset**. The models are built using **scikit-learn**, and include variations with different types of **regularization** and **dimensionality reduction using PCA**.
